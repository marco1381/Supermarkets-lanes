# Supermarkets-lanes - Supermarket Checkout Lane Queue Simulation System

## Overview

This project is a Python-based simulation system designed to manage customer checkout lanes in a supermarket environment. It models the behavior of both regular and self-service lanes, dynamically opening and closing lanes based on customer demand. The simulation aims to reduce queue waiting times and provide insight into lane management efficiency. This project builds on object-oriented programming concepts and is part of a coursework exercise aimed at showcasing skills in Python programming.

## Features

- **Lane Management**: Dynamically open and close lanes based on customer traffic.
- **Customer Queueing**: Assign customers to lanes based on the number of items in their basket.
- **Checkout Simulation**: Process customer checkouts and dynamically update the lane queue.
- **Self-Service Support**: Model self-service lanes with separate queueing logic.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Control the simulation via a simple Tkinter-based GUI.

## Project Structure

- **Coursework1.py**: Core implementation of the checkout lane management system.
- **Cw1.py**: Helper script containing additional logic for customer management.
- **Gui.py**: Tkinter-based GUI for controlling the simulation.
- **README_SCHEME_PROJECT.docx**: Documentation for the simulation scheme and its components.
- **README_SCHEME_LOOGBOOK.docx**: Detailed logbook outlining the design and implementation process.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries (e.g., Tkinter for GUI):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
